# Scraping_SHEGLAM

A Data Science project that leverages Selenium to scrape product data from the [SHEGLAM](https://www.sheglam.com/) website. The project focuses on collecting detailed information about products, including:

- Product Names  
- Prices  
- Categories  
- Ratings

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a real-world data science pipeline:

1. Web Scraping  
   Using `Selenium` to dynamically extract product details from the SHEGLAM website.

2. Data Preprocessing  
   Cleaning and organizing the raw scraped data using `pandas`.

3. Data Analysis & Visualization  
   Exploring trends, price ranges, category distributions, and rating summaries using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

4. Interactive Dashboard  
   Displaying insights via an interactive web app built with `Streamlit`.
